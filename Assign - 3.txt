1. Define Function
Ans :
In SQL, a function is a set of SQL statements that perform a specific task and return a value. Functions can be used to encapsulate repetitive tasks, making your SQL code more modular, readable, and maintainable. There are two main types of functions in SQL: built-in functions and user-defined functions (UDFs).



2. What are types of functions in SQL

Types of Functions
Built-in Functions: These are functions provided by SQL databases for common tasks, such as string manipulation, mathematical calculations, and date/time operations.
User-Defined Functions (UDFs): These are custom functions created by users to perform specific tasks not covered by built-in functions

Creating a User-Defined Function
User-defined functions can be categorized into three types:

Scalar Functions: Return a single value.
Inline Table-Valued Functions (ITVF): Return a table as the result of a single SELECT statement.
Multi-Statement Table-Valued Functions (MSTVF): Return a table as the result of multiple SQL statements.


Built-in functions in SQL Catagories:
1. String Functions
String functions perform operations on string data types such as CHAR and VARCHAR.

LEN: Returns the length of a string.
SELECT LEN('Hello') AS Length;
SUBSTRING: Extracts a substring from a string.
SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello', 2, 3) AS SubStr;
UPPER: Converts a string to uppercase.
SELECT UPPER('hello') AS Uppercase;
LOWER: Converts a string to lowercase.
SELECT LOWER('HELLO') AS Lowercase;
TRIM: Removes leading and trailing spaces
SELECT TRIM('  Hello  ') AS Trimmed;
REPLACE: Replaces occurrences of a specified substring.
SELECT REPLACE('Hello World', 'World', 'SQL') AS Replaced;

2. Mathematical Functions
Mathematical functions perform operations on numeric data types such as INT, FLOAT, and DECIMAL.

ABS: Returns the absolute value of a number.
SELECT ABS(-10) AS AbsoluteValue;
ROUND: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places
SELECT ROUND(123.4567, 2) AS Rounded;
POWER: Raises a number to a specified power.
SELECT POWER(2, 3) AS Power;
SQRT: Returns the square root of a number
SELECT SQRT(16) AS SquareRoot;
CEILING: Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number
SELECT CEILING(4.3) AS Ceiling;
FLOOR: Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number.
SELECT FLOOR(4.7) AS Floor;

3. Date and Time Functions
Date and time functions perform operations on date and time data types such as DATE, TIME, and DATETIME.

GETDATE: Returns the current date and time.
SELECT GETDATE() AS CurrentDateTime;
DATEADD: Adds a specified number of units to a date.
SELECT DATEADD(day, 5, '2023-01-01') AS NewDate;
DATEDIFF: Returns the difference between two dates.
SELECT DATEDIFF(day, '2023-01-01', '2023-01-10') AS DateDifference;
DATENAME: Returns a specified part of a date as a string.
SELECT DATENAME(month, '2023-01-01') AS MonthName;
DATEPART: Returns a specified part of a date as an integer.
SELECT DATEPART(year, '2023-01-01') AS YearPart;

4. Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value.

SUM: Returns the sum of a set of values.
SELECT SUM(salary) AS TotalSalary FROM employees;
AVG: Returns the average of a set of values.
SELECT AVG(salary) AS AverageSalary FROM employees;
COUNT: Returns the number of items in a set.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees FROM employees;
MAX: Returns the maximum value in a set.
SELECT MAX(salary) AS MaxSalary FROM employees;
MIN: Returns the minimum value in a set.
SELECT MIN(salary) AS MinSalary FROM employees;

5. Conversion Functions
Conversion functions convert a value from one data type to another.

CAST: Converts a value to a specified data type.
SELECT CAST('123' AS INT) AS ConvertedValue;
CONVERT: Converts a value to a specified data type with an optional style.
SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR, GETDATE(), 101) AS ConvertedDate;

6. Null Functions
Null functions handle NULL values in various ways.

ISNULL: Replaces NULL with a specified value
SELECT ISNULL(commission, 0) AS Commission FROM employees;
COALESCE: Returns the first non-NULL value in a list.
SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, 'SQL') AS FirstNonNull;

7. Other Functions
CASE: Provides conditional logic similar to an IF-THEN-ELSE statement
SELECT name,
       CASE 
           WHEN salary > 5000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN salary BETWEEN 3000 AND 5000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS SalaryRange
FROM employees;
IIF: A shorthand way to write a simple CASE statement.
SELECT name, IIF(salary > 5000, 'High', 'Low') AS SalaryRange FROM employees;

3. Difference between Single row and multi row functions

Single-row functions operate on individual rows and return a single value for each row processed. These functions are used to manipulate or calculate values on a row-by-row basis.
	Types of Single-Row Functions:
	1.String Functions: Manipulate string values.
	2.Mathematical Functions: Perform mathematical operations.
	3.Date and Time Functions: Handle date and time values
	4.Conversion Functions: Convert data from one type to another.
	5.Null Functions: Handle NULL values.
	
Multi-Row Functions (Aggregate Functions)
Multi-row functions, also known as aggregate functions, perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single result. These functions are used to aggregate data from multiple rows into a summary value.

Types of Multi-Row Functions:
SUM(): Calculates the sum of values.
AVG(): Calculates the average of values.
COUNT(): Counts the number of rows or non-NULL values.
MAX(): Finds the maximum value
MIN(): Finds the minimum value
GROUP_CONCAT() (or similar): Concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string (syntax varies by SQL database).
SELECT department_id, GROUP_CONCAT(name SEPARATOR ', ') AS EmployeeNames
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

Key Differences
Operation Scope:

Single-Row Functions: Operate on individual rows, returning a single result per row.
Multi-Row Functions: Operate on multiple rows, returning a single result for the entire set of rows.
Usage Context:

Single-Row Functions: Used in SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and HAVING clauses to manipulate or compute values for individual rows.
Multi-Row Functions: Used with GROUP BY to summarize or aggregate data across groups of rows.
Result Type:

Single-Row Functions: Return a single value per row.
Multi-Row Functions: Return a single summary value for the entire result set or group of rows.
Example Usage:

Single-Row Function: SELECT UPPER(name) FROM employees;
Multi-Row Function: SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
4. Difference between Least and min function with example

The LEAST and MIN functions in SQL are used to determine the smallest value, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

LEAST Function
Purpose: The LEAST function returns the smallest value from a list of expressions. It can compare multiple values or columns.
Usage: Useful for finding the minimum value among several columns or expressions within a single row.
LEAST(expression1, expression2, ...)
SELECT product_id,
       LEAST(price_2022, price_2023, price_2024) AS lowest_price
FROM sales;

MIN Function
Purpose: The MIN function returns the smallest value from a column across multiple rows. It is used with aggregate queries to find the minimum value of a column in a result set.
Usage: Useful for finding the minimum value of a single column in a group of rows.

MIN(column_name)
SELECT MIN(price_2022) AS min_price_2022,
       MIN(price_2023) AS min_price_2023,
       MIN(price_2024) AS min_price_2024
FROM sales;

Key Differences
Scope of Comparison:

LEAST: Compares values within a single row. It is useful for determining the smallest value among several columns or expressions within that row.
MIN: Finds the minimum value in a column across multiple rows. It is used to aggregate data from multiple rows and is typically used in conjunction with GROUP BY.
Usage Context:

LEAST: Applied to columns or expressions within the same row.
MIN: Applied to a single column across all rows (or groups of rows if used with GROUP BY).
Example Use Cases:

LEAST: To find the smallest value among multiple columns in a row.
MIN: To find the smallest value in a column across all rows in a table or within each group of rows.
Understanding these differences helps in choosing the appropriate function for your SQL queries based on whether you need to compare values within a single row or aggregate values across multiple rows.


5. Difference between Greatest and max function with example
GREATEST Function
Purpose: The GREATEST function returns the largest value from a list of expressions or columns within a single row. It is used to compare multiple columns or expressions within the same row and return the highest value.
Usage: Useful when you need to determine the largest value among several columns or expressions for each row.
GREATEST(expression1, expression2, ...)
SELECT product_id,
       GREATEST(price_2022, price_2023, price_2024) AS highest_price
FROM sales;

MAX Function
Purpose: The MAX function returns the largest value from a column across multiple rows. It is an aggregate function used to find the maximum value of a column in a set of rows.
Usage: Useful for finding the highest value in a single column, either for the entire table or within each group when used with GROUP BY.
GREATEST Function
Purpose: The GREATEST function returns the largest value from a list of expressions or columns within a single row. It is used to compare multiple columns or expressions within the same row and return the highest value.
Usage: Useful when you need to determine the largest value among several columns or expressions for each row.
MAX(column_name)
SELECT MAX(price_2022) AS max_price_2022,
       MAX(price_2023) AS max_price_2023,
       MAX(price_2024) AS max_price_2024
FROM sales;

Key Differences
Scope of Comparison:

GREATEST: Compares values within a single row. It returns the largest value among the specified expressions or columns for that row.
MAX: Finds the maximum value in a single column across multiple rows. It aggregates data to return the highest value from the entire column or from grouped rows.
Usage Context:

GREATEST: Used to compare values from multiple columns or expressions in a single row.
MAX: Used to find the highest value in a column across all rows or within each group when used with GROUP BY.
Example Use Cases:

GREATEST: To find the highest value among several columns in the same row.
MAX: To find the highest value in a single column across multiple rows or groups.


6. Define coalesce function with example

The COALESCE function in SQL is used to handle NULL values by returning the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions. It is commonly used to provide default values when encountering NULL values in a query.
COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ..., expressionN)

Key Points
Evaluates Expressions: The function evaluates each expression in the order provided and returns the first non-NULL value.
Default Value: It is often used to provide a default value when dealing with potential NULL values.
Versatility: It can handle different data types as long as the expressions are compatible with each other.

SELECT name,
       COALESCE(commission, bonus, 0) AS compensation
FROM employees;

7. Difference between ifnull, nullif and isnull functions, give an example for each function

The IFNULL, NULLIF, and ISNULL functions in SQL are used to handle NULL values.
1. IFNULL Function
Purpose: The IFNULL function is used to replace NULL values with a specified replacement value. If the expression is not NULL, it returns the expression itself.
IFNULL(expression, replacement_value)
Usage: Commonly used to provide a default value for NULL values in a result set.

2. NULLIF Function
Purpose: The NULLIF function returns NULL if two expressions are equal. Otherwise, it returns the first expression
NULLIF(expression1, expression2)

3. ISNULL Function
Purpose: The ISNULL function is used to replace NULL values with a specified replacement value. It is similar to IFNULL but is used in different SQL dialects.
ISNULL(expression, replacement_value)
8. Difference between coalesce and ifnull function and when we use coalesce and ifnull with example

COALESCE Function
Purpose: COALESCE returns the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions. It can take multiple expressions and will return the first one that is not NULL. If all expressions are NULL, COALESCE returns NULL.
COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ..., expressionN)
Usage: COALESCE is useful when you need to check multiple columns or expressions and return the first non-NULL value. It is compatible with various SQL dialects including MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

IFNULL Function
Purpose: IFNULL is used to replace NULL values with a specified replacement value. It takes two arguments: the expression to check and the value to return if the expression is NULL.
IFNULL(expression, replacement_value)

Usage: IFNULL is commonly used in MySQL and similar databases to handle NULL values by providing a single fallback value. It is less flexible than COALESCE as it only handles two arguments.

Key Differences
Number of Arguments:

COALESCE: Can take multiple arguments and returns the first non-NULL value.
IFNULL: Takes exactly two arguments—an expression to check and a default value to return if the expression is NULL.
Functionality:

COALESCE: More flexible for handling multiple potential NULL values. It can be used with various expressions to determine the first non-NULL value.
IFNULL: Simpler, but limited to replacing NULL with a single specified value.
SQL Dialects:

COALESCE: Supported in most SQL databases including MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
IFNULL: Primarily used in MySQL and some other SQL databases, but not standard across all SQL databases.

9. Difference between concat and group_concat fucntions with example and define when we use

CONCAT Function
Purpose: The CONCAT function is used to concatenate multiple string values or expressions into a single string. It operates on a row-by-row basis.
CONCAT(string1, string2, ..., stringN)
Usage: Use CONCAT to combine strings or expressions from different columns or literals in a single row.

Example of CONCAT
Consider a table employees with columns first_name and last_name. You want to create a full name by concatenating these two columns.

sql
Copy code
SELECT first_name,
       last_name,
       CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM employees;
If the employees table has the following data:

first_name	last_name
John	Doe
Jane	Smith
Alice	Jones
The result would be:

first_name	last_name	full_name
John	Doe	John Doe
Jane	Smith	Jane Smith
Alice	Jones	Alice Jones
GROUP_CONCAT Function
Purpose: The GROUP_CONCAT function is used to concatenate values from multiple rows into a single string. It aggregates values from rows that are grouped together, typically used in conjunction with GROUP BY.

Syntax:

sql
Copy code
GROUP_CONCAT(expression [ORDER BY expression] [SEPARATOR 'separator'])
Usage: Use GROUP_CONCAT to combine values from multiple rows into a single, comma-separated string or another specified separator.

Example of GROUP_CONCAT
Consider a table orders with columns customer_id and product_name. You want to list all products ordered by each customer in a single row.

sql
Copy code
SELECT customer_id,
       GROUP_CONCAT(product_name ORDER BY product_name ASC SEPARATOR ', ') AS products_ordered
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
If the orders table has the following data:

customer_id	product_name
1	Apple
1	Banana
2	Orange
2	Pear
2	Grape
The result would be:

customer_id	products_ordered
1	Apple, Banana
2	Grape, Orange, Pear
Key Differences
Functionality:

CONCAT: Combines multiple string values or expressions within a single row. It does not aggregate across rows.
GROUP_CONCAT: Aggregates values from multiple rows into a single concatenated string for each group of rows defined by GROUP BY.
Usage Context:

CONCAT: Used for creating a single concatenated string from columns or literals within the same row.
GROUP_CONCAT: Used for creating a single concatenated string from multiple rows, often to summarize or group data.
SQL Dialects:

CONCAT: Available in many SQL databases including MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
GROUP_CONCAT: Primarily available in MySQL and some other SQL databases. It may have different names or syntax in other databases (e.g., STRING_AGG in PostgreSQL).
When to Use
Use CONCAT when you need to concatenate multiple strings or columns in a single row. It’s suitable for combining fields or literals into one result for each row.

GROUP_CONCAT Function
Purpose: The GROUP_CONCAT function is used to concatenate values from multiple rows into a single string. It aggregates values from rows that are grouped together, typically used in conjunction with GROUP BY.

Syntax:
GROUP_CONCAT(expression [ORDER BY expression] [SEPARATOR 'separator'])



10. Explain case statement and when we use with example
The CASE statement in SQL is a versatile tool used to perform conditional logic within a query. It allows you to return different values based on the evaluation of certain conditions. It is often used to create new columns, apply conditional formatting, or control the output of queries.

CASE expression
    WHEN value1 THEN result1
    WHEN value2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE default_result
END
11. Give an example for if function with explination

The IF function in SQL is used to return one value if a specified condition evaluates to true, and another value if it evaluates to false.
IF(condition, true_value, false_value)
SELECT student_id,
       name,
       score,
       IF(score >= 60, 'Pass', 'Fail') AS result
FROM students;
